# SSH-Yeet3r

A python GUI tool to ssh into servers and execute common commands.

This tool allows a user to enter a host and MAC that will be connected to via ssh to execute a WOL command.

I created this project to learn how to create a gui with tkinter and work with threading in python.

# Installation

You will need to have python 3.8.x on your system. 

Open the command line and clone the directory with ```git clone http://172.16.8.229:3000/jstaley/SSH-Yeet3r.git```

Navigate into the directory and install the required packages ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

From here no you can run the program with ```python ssh-yeet3r.py```
